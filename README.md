Breakout PCB for Supermini/Promicro nRF52840 board with Heltec HT-RA62 LoRa module (and I2C and voltage measurement)

The first ver_1 is without voltage measurement and i2c bus, but you can solder the necessary elements yourself, 2 x equal resistors about 300-500 kohm and wire i2c.

The second ver_2 has PCB fields for two SMD 1206 resistors and a pinout directly under i2c like INA219.

Good luck :)
